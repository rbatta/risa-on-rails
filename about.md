Hi, I'm Risa. I am a professional flailer. You know, I flail my arms wildly about and hope that what I've done works. And it does, usually. Eventually. 

In reality, right now I'm playing DevOps and Developer for an awesome dev shop called NIRD. (how cool is that?)  

On the side, I'm pretty addicted to the following in no particular order: learning, internet memes, cats, gifs, curvy mountain roads, MINI Coopers, adventures, and San Francisco.  If you live in San Francisco and want to go driving along some curvy mountain roads with me, let me know! :D We've got some amazing roads around here. :) 

As much as I love technology, I'm not very good with Twitter, Pintrest, Instagram, or Facebook. You can say I'm just not good with the whole social media thing, and I'm cool with that. Reddit and Tumblr's where it's at anyway.

The more professional about me:

Risa spent the majority of her career in the pharmaceutical and defense industries on the East Coast before moving to San Francisco to pursue a career in the tech industry. She's an avid supporter of pair programming, a Ruby on Rails enthusiast, and a budding Postgres fan. She loves to give presentations and enjoys elevating people's game, mostly women in STEM fields. Risa is also a speaker for Women Who Code and a member of Lesbians Who Tech.  She drives an awesome electric blue MINI Cooper S named Sebastian.
